//👨‍🏫 Your task
In your project, when a user searches for a city (example: New York), it should display the name of the city on the result page and the current temperature of the city.

Please note: there's no need to include a temperature conversion at the moment. This will be taught later on in the course.

🙀 Bonus point:
Add a Current Location button. When clicking on it, it uses the Geolocation API to get your GPS coordinates and display and the city and current temperature using the OpenWeather API.
